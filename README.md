# I AM RICH

I Am Rich is an iOS application developed by Armin Heinrich and which was distributed using the App Store. When launched, the screen only contains a glowing red gem and an icon that, when pressed, displays the following mantra in large text:

I am rich
I deserve it
I am good,
healthy & successful

The application is described as "a work of art with no hidden function at all", with its only purpose being to show other people that they were able to afford it 

"I Am Rich" was sold on the App Store for US$999.99 (equivalent to $1,202 in 2020), €799.99 (equivalent to €934.74 in 2021), and GB£599.99 (equivalent to £806.54 in 2019), the highest price Apple allowed for App Store content. 

The application was removed from the App Store without explanation by Apple Inc. the day after its release, August 6, 2008.

## Inspiration

This APP was inspired on the original "I Am Rich" application and it was coded by using Android Studio.
